Fake News Detection on Social Media using Intel OneAPI
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news on social media using machine learning techniques. The AI model is optimized using Intel OneAPI's powerful libraries, such as oneDNN for deep learning model training and oneMKL for efficient data processing. The project can analyze text content from various social media platforms, flagging misinformation in real time.

## Prerequisites
Intel OneAPI Toolkit
Python 3.8 or above
Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploration)
Necessary Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
Installation
1. Set up Intel OneAPI:
Ensure you have the Intel OneAPI Base Toolkit installed on your system. You can download it from Intel's official website here.

2. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
For this project, any publicly available dataset containing fake news and real news articles can be used. For instance, the Fake News Dataset from Kaggle includes useful labels and features for model training.

Place the dataset in the data/raw/ directory.

Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for model training, you need to clean and preprocess the raw data:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and correct anomalies.
Text Tokenization: Convert text to a numerical format using techniques like word embeddings (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec).
Normalization: Standardize text length and apply other preprocessing techniques.
Run the preprocessing script:

bash
Copy code
python src/preprocessing.py
This will generate the processed dataset in the data/processed/ directory.

Model Development
Model Architecture
We will use a deep learning model such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for text classification, as these models work well for sequence-based data like social media posts.

Training
The src/model.py script uses Intel oneDNN to accelerate the model training process.

Steps:

Load the processed data.
Split the data into training and validation sets.
Define the RNN/LSTM model architecture using TensorFlow or PyTorch, optimized with Intel oneDNN.
Train the model and save it in the results/ directory.

Run the training script:

python src/model.py

Evaluation
The model's performance will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
The evaluation results will be stored in the results/ directory.

Inference
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict whether a social media post or article is real or fake:

Steps:

* Load the trained model.
* Provide new input data for prediction.
*The script will output whether the content is likely real or fake.

Run the inference script:

bash
```python src/inference.py
```

Results

The results of the model, including predictions and evaluation metrics, will be stored in the results/ directory. You can visualize these results using tools like Matplotlib or Plotly.

## Optimization with Intel OneAPI

To further enhance performance, this project leverages Intel OneAPI's features:

* Intel oneMKL: Accelerates matrix operations within the model to improve training time.

* Quantization: Uses Intel's quantization tools to reduce model size and inference time with minimal accuracy loss.

* Parallelization: Uses Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) to parallelize parts of the code for faster data processing.

## Future Enhancements

* Real-time Data: Integrate real-time social media data for live predictions.

* Model Tuning: Experiment with different architectures (like BERT or GRU) and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

* Visualization: Add a web interface for users to visualize detection results and explore flagged content.
